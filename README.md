# react-todos 📝

## What is it

- little todolist app featuring supabase as a backend, written in typescript, react, redux and styled-components
- auth is handled through supabase's magic email link
- built using vite
- should be deployed on http://jakubjun.cz

## How to run
- use node 18
- `npm install` to install deps.
- `npm test` to run both of the test suites 😎
- `npm run dev` for local development on http://localhost:5173/
- `npm run build` to generate deployable structure in `dist` folder
- `./generateTypes.sh` to connect to postgres and generate types from it (requires postgres password and running docker daemon (supabase requires it))
